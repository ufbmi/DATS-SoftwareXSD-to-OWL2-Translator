disease surveillance data	NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases (2015)	NNDSS - Table I. infrequently reported notifiable diseases - 2015. In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnote:-: No reported cases N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. NP: Nationally notifiable but not published. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ??? Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesS.... ?? Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. The total sum of incident cases is then divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. ?? Data for the Arboviral disease, Chikungunya, and Hantavirus infection disease, non-Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for these conditions. ** Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. ????? Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/downloads.html. ???? Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II. ???? Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. *** Please refer to the MMWR publication for weekly updates to the footnote for this condition. ???????

location	Air Quality Measures on the National Environmental Health Tracking Network	The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the "gold standard" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include "Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)". Please visit the Tracking homepage for this information.View additional information for indicator definitions and documentation by selecting Content Area "Air Quality" and the respective indicator at the following website: http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showIndicatorsData.action 	https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv	Air Pollution	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention	2015-12-16	null	null	http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/	https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD	CSV	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	null	abiotic ecosystem in United States	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000005549

disease surveillance data	Counts of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1984-2005	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/US.62479008	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/US.62479008/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/US.62479008	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:US	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; HIV-1 in the United States	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000021;http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000230

One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/US.14535005	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/US.14535005/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/US.14535005	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:US	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; Human poliovirus 1 in United States; Human poliovirus 3 in United States	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000021; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001731

Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/US.274081004	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/US.274081004/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/US.274081004	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:US	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; Shigella sonnei in the United States; Shigella dysenteriae in the United States; Shigella flexneri in the United States	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000021; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001846; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001870; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001862								
disease surveillance data	Counts of Brucellosis reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1945-1983	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors.

One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/AS.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/AS.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/AS.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	AMERICAN SAMOA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:AS	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of AMERICAN SAMOA; Aedes aegypti in region of AMERICAN SAMOA; Aedes albopictus in region of AMERICAN SAMOA; Dengue virus in region of AMERICAN SAMOA	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001563; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001626; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001630; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001828

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in BELIZE: 1998-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/CL.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/CL.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/CL.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	CHILE	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:CL	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of CHILE; Aedes aegypti in region of CHILE; Aedes albopictus in region of CHILE; Dengue virus in region of CHILE	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000872; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001287; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001288; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001662

We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/DO.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/DO.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/DO.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	DOMINICAN REPUBLIC	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:DO	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of DOMINICAN REPUBLIC; Aedes aegypti in region of DOMINICAN REPUBLIC; Aedes albopictus in region of DOMINICAN REPUBLIC; Dengue virus in region of DOMINICAN REPUBLIC	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000886; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001329; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001330; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001656

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in GUATEMALA: 1995-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/KR.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/KR.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/KR.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	KOREA (REPUBLIC OF)	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:KR	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of KOREA (REPUBLIC OF); Aedes aegypti in region of KOREA (REPUBLIC OF); Aedes albopictus in region of KOREA (REPUBLIC OF); Dengue virus in region of KOREA (REPUBLIC OF)	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000977; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001241; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001242; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001679

For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/FM.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/FM.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/FM.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	MICRONESIA (FEDERATED STATES OF)	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:FM	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of MICRONESIA (FEDERATED STATES OF); Aedes aegypti in region of MICRONESIA (FEDERATED STATES OF); Aedes albopictus in region of MICRONESIA (FEDERATED STATES OF); Dengue virus in region of MICRONESIA (FEDERATED STATES OF)	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000871; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001315; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001316; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001836								
disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in MONGOLIA: 2004-2009	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in PAPUA NEW GUINEA: 2009-2009	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year).

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/MF.20927009	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/MF.20927009/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/MF.20927009	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART)	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:MF	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Aedes aegypti in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Aedes albopictus in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Dengue virus in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART)	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001504; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001375; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001376; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001645

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in TUVALU: 2004-2009	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in WALLIS AND FUTUNA: 2008-2008	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year).

The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/BD.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/BD.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/BD.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	BANGLADESH	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:BD	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of BANGLADESH; Aedes aegypti in region of BANGLADESH; Aedes albopictus in region of BANGLADESH; Dengue virus in region of BANGLADESH	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000894; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001403; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001404; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001669

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue reported in CANADA: 2009-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/CW.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/CW.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/CW.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	CURA√áAO	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:CW	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of CURA√áAO; Aedes aegypti in region of CURA√áAO; Aedes albopictus in region of CURA√áAO; Dengue virus in region of CURA√áAO	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001513; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001634; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001635; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001644

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue reported in GUADELOUPE: 1980-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/ID.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/ID.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/ID.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	INDONESIA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:ID	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of INDONESIA; Aedes aegypti in region of INDONESIA; Aedes albopictus in region of INDONESIA; Dengue virus in region of INDONESIA	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000937; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001347; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001348; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001643

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue reported in MARSHALL ISLANDS: 1989-2010	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/NP.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/NP.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/NP.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	NEPAL	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:NP	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of NEPAL; Aedes aegypti in region of NEPAL; Aedes albopictus in region of NEPAL; Dengue virus in region of NEPAL	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000864; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001281; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001282; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001712

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue reported in PARAGUAY: 1988-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/MF.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/MF.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/MF.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART)	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:MF	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Aedes aegypti in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Aedes albopictus in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART); Dengue virus in region of SAINT MARTIN (FRENCH PART)	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001504; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001375; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001376; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001645

The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/TW.38362002	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke; Marc Choisy	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/TW.38362002/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/TW.38362002	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:TW	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA; Aedes aegypti in region of TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA; Aedes albopictus in region of TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA; Dengue virus in region of TAIWAN, PROVINCE OF CHINA	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000816; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001452; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001453; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001648

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue reported in URUGUAY: 2003-2012	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/AI.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/AI.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/AI.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	ANGUILLA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:AI	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of ANGUILLA; Aedes aegypti in region of ANGUILLA; Aedes albopictus in region of ANGUILLA; Dengue virus in region of ANGUILLA	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001447; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001311; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001312; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001708

For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/BZ.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/BZ.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/BZ.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	BELIZE	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:BZ	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of BELIZE; Aedes aegypti in region of BELIZE; Aedes albopictus in region of BELIZE; Dengue virus in region of BELIZE	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000855; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001333; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001334; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001668								
disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in BERMUDA: 1995-2004	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in COLOMBIA: 1960-2005	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/FJ.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/FJ.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/FJ.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	FIJI	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:FJ	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of FIJI; Aedes aegypti in region of FIJI; Aedes albopictus in region of FIJI; Dengue virus in region of FIJI	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000822; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001341; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001342; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001689

For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/HT.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/HT.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/HT.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	HAITI	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:HT	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of HAITI; Aedes aegypti in region of HAITI; Aedes albopictus in region of HAITI; Dengue virus in region of HAITI	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000906; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001401; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001402; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001690								
disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in HONDURAS: 1978-2005	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in MALDIVES: 1988-1999	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year).

These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/NC.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/NC.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/NC.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	NEW CALEDONIA	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:NC	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of NEW CALEDONIA; Aedes aegypti in region of NEW CALEDONIA; Aedes albopictus in region of NEW CALEDONIA; Dengue virus in region of NEW CALEDONIA	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001543; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001814; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001822; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001711

For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/PY.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/PY.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/PY.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	PARAGUAY	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:PY	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of PARAGUAY; Aedes aegypti in region of PARAGUAY; Aedes albopictus in region of PARAGUAY; Dengue virus in region of PARAGUAY	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000960; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001337; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001338; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001717								
disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in PERU: 1988-2005	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Dengue without warning signs reported in SINGAPORE: 2005-2008	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.

The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/TT.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/TT.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/TT.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:TT	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO; Aedes aegypti in region of TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO; Aedes albopictus in region of TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO; Dengue virus in region of TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000000861; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001351; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001352; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001702

All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year). Given the different nature of these two types of case count data, we indicated this with an attribute for each count value, named "PartOfCumulativeCountSeries".  	10.25337/T7/ptycho.v2.0/VG.722862003	null	Willem Van Panhuis; Anne Cross; Donald Burke	2018-01-30	null	null	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/VG.722862003/	http://www.tycho.pitt.edu/tycho/dataset/download/VG.722862003	CSV	Project Tycho Data Standard; bsg-s000718	Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International	VIRGIN ISLANDS (BRITISH)	https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:code:3166:VG	null	null	null	FALSE	FALSE	humans in region of VIRGIN ISLANDS (BRITISH); Aedes aegypti in British Virgin Islands; Aedes albopictus in British Virgin Islands; Dengue virus in British Virgin Islands	http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001441; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001325; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001326; http://www.pitt.edu/obc/IDE_0000001667

disease surveillance data	Counts of Giardiasis reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 2001-2016	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Infection caused by larvae of Trichinella reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1951-1955	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year).

disease surveillance data	Counts of Invasive meningococcal disease reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 2006-2006	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series.

Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals. Case count series with fixed time intervals consist of mutually exclusive time intervals that all start and end on different dates and all have identical length (day, week, month, year).

disease surveillance data	Counts of Meningitis reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1905-1959	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Post-infectious encephalitis reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1963-1994	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Streptococcal sore throat reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1960-1961	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates.

disease surveillance data	Counts of Varicella reported in UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: 1889-2016	Project Tycho datasets contain case counts for reported disease conditions for countries around the world. The Project Tycho data curation team extracts these case counts from various reputable sources, typically from national or international health authorities, such as the US Centers for Disease Control or the World Health Organization. These original data sources include both open- and restricted-access sources. For restricted-access sources, the Project Tycho team has obtained permission for redistribution from data contributors. All datasets contain case count data that are identical to counts published in the original source and no counts have been modified in any way by the Project Tycho team. The Project Tycho team has pre-processed datasets by adding new variables, such as standard disease and location identifiers, that improve data interpretability. We also formatted the data into a standard data format.  Each Project Tycho dataset contains case counts for a specific condition (e.g. measles) and for a specific country (e.g. The United States). Case counts are reported per time interval. In addition to case counts, datasets include information about these counts (attributes), such as the location, age group, subpopulation, diagnostic certainty, place of acquisition, and the source from which we extracted case counts. One dataset can include many series of case count time intervals, such as "US measles cases as reported by CDC", or "US measles cases reported by WHO", or "US measles cases that originated abroad", etc.   Depending on the intended use of a dataset, we recommend a few data processing steps before analysis: - Analyze missing data: Project Tycho datasets do not include time intervals for which no case count was reported (for many datasets, time series of case counts are incomplete, due to incompleteness of source documents) and users will need to add time intervals for which no count value is available. Project Tycho datasets do include time intervals for which a case count value of zero was reported. - Separate cumulative from non-cumulative time interval series. Case count time series in Project Tycho datasets can be "cumulative" or "fixed-intervals". Cumulative case count time series consist of overlapping case count intervals starting on the same date, but ending on different dates. For example, each interval in a cumulative count time series can start on January 1st, but end on January 7th, 14th, 21st, etc. It is common practice among public health agencies to report cases for cumulative time intervals.
