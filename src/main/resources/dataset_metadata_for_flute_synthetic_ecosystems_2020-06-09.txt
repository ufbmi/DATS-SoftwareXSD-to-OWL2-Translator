agent level ecosystem census	Los Angeles County	Description from the FluTE github repository (from which these files were downloaded):\n\nFluTE is an individual-based model that runs in discrete time, with two time steps per simulation day, representing day and night.\n\nTo help prepare for future influenza seasonal epidemics or pandemics, we developed a new stochastic model of the spread of influenza across a large population. Individuals in this model have realistic social contact networks, and transmission and infections are based on the current state of knowledge of the natural history of influenza. The model has been calibrated so that outcomes are consistent with the 1957/1958 Asian A(H2N2) and 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) influenza viruses. We present examples of how this model can be used to study the dynamics of influenza epidemics in the United States and simulate how to mitigate or delay them using pharmaceutical interventions and social distancing measures.\n\nLos Angeles County.  la-tracts.dat is not from the 2000 Census;  It is based on 2007 PEPS estimates from Walter R.
