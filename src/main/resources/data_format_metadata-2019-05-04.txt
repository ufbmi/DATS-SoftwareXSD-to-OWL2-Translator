BehaviorSpace runs a model many times, systematically varying the model's settings and recording the results of each model run. This process is sometimes called "parameter sweeping". It lets you explore the model's "space" of possible behaviors and determine which combinations of settings cause the behaviors of interest.  The need for this type of experiment is revealed by the following observations. Models often have many settings, each of which can take a range of values. Together they form what in mathematics is called a parameter space for the model, whose dimensions are the number of settings, and in which every point is a particular combination of values. Running a model with different settings (and sometimes even the same ones) can lead to drastically different behavior in the system being modeled. So, how are you to know which particular configuration of values, or types of configurations, will yield the kind of behavior you are interested in? This amounts to the question of where in its huge, multi-dimension parameter space does your model perform best?  For example, suppose you want speedy synchronization from the agents in the Fireflies model. The model has four sliders - number, cycle-length, flash-length and number-flashes - that have approximately 2000, 100, 10 and 3 possible values, respectively. That means there are 2000 * 100 * 10 * 3 = 600,000 possible combinations of slider values! Trying combinations one at a time is hardly an efficient way to learn which one will evoke the speediest synchronization.  BehaviorSpace offers you a much better way to solve this problem. If you specify a subset of values from the ranges of each slider, it will run the model with each possible combination of those values and, during each model run, record the results. In doing so, it samples the model's parameter space - not exhaustively, but enough so that you will be able to see relationships form between different sliders and the behavior of the system. After all the runs are over, a dataset is generated which you can open in a different tool, such as a spreadsheet, database, or scientific visualization application, and explore.  By enabling you to explore the entire "space" of behaviors a model can exhibit, BehaviorSpace can be a powerful assistant to the modeler.	null	1	null	null	null	null	NetLogo BehaviorSpace Input Format	MDC:netlogo-behaviorspace-input-format-v1.0;		true

Date ranges can be specified using PeriodStartDate and PeriodEndDate, and the operators =, >=, and <= . Dates must always be specified in the format YYYY-MM-DD.  ADDITIONAL OPTIONAL QUERY PARAMETERS limit - how many rows of results to retrieve. By default, the API query retrieves a limit of 5000 rows per call. Maximum limit is 20,000. offset - for paging of results. For example, given a limit of 5000, specifying offset=5000 will return results starting at row 5001 (i.e., page 2 of the results). If the offset is greater than the number of data rows, "No results" will be returned.	null	2	null	null	null	null	Project Tycho Repository Web Service Parameters	MDC:project-tycho-repository-web-service-parameters-v2.0;		true
