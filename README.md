# DATS-SoftwareXSD to OWL2 Translator
Software program that helps to convert conventional representations of datasets and data formats represented in DATS and software in the MIDAS ISG Software XSD into OWL 2 representations of those datasets, data formats, and software

This software was written by Bill Hogan and Matt Diller under the auspices of the MIDAS ISG cooperative agreement from NIGMS that ran from 2014-2019 (NCE ending in 2020).

It takes conventional representations of data formats and datasets encoded as DATS 2.0 and transforms them to OWL 2.  Similarly, the MIDAS ISG created its own software XSD based largely on schema.org. The software in this repository takes JSON-based conversions of XML that represents MIDAS software (such as FRED) as input, and outputs OWL 2 representations of MIDAS software.
